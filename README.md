## 🧑‍🏫 About Me

I'm **Evgeni Bourd**, a software architect with a strong focus on:

- Backend engines & language design (expert)
- Software design
- Constraint solving
- Python / C / C++ (not expert, but functional)
- AI (intermediate)
- Chess (master level)
- 3D printing (master level)
- Occasional random side projects
- Web/backend development outside my own stuff (1/5, proudly)

This site is the hub where all of these collide into something vaguely resembling a personal brand.
